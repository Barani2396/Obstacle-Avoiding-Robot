# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot
Simulink model for autonomous robot

Description

Obstacle avoiding robot is an autonomous device that can automatically detect an obstacle and avoid it by turning in a different direction. This design enables the system to avoid collisions during operation in any environment. With a system that satisfies the prime prerequisite for any autonomous robot, the obstacle detection robot has multiple applications in various fields, particularly in the manufacturing industry where the percentage of human error is high.
